## Occupational CLAssifications and CrosswalKs
For the study of historical and contemporary occupational stratification structures, numerous occupational classifications exist. Moreover various classifications and schemas exist to monitor movement across the stratification structure (e.g. social mobility).
This repository is a modest attempt to provide some of the more common occupational classifications and crosswalks between different classifications. This is definitely not an undertaking that can be completedly by a single person, so please feel free to add your own, or report what you think is missing, by clicking on the issue button (!) on the top right.
